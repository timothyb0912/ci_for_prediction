# Causal Inference for Prediction

This repo holds the source fiels for a small note titled "On the Importance of Modeling Unmeasured Confounders in Predictive Inference."

This note is a response to the premise that "if one's goal is purely to make predictions without interventions, then causal inference techniques are unnecessary."

This position, as stated, is of course a straw man. However, the underlying sentiment is frequently expressed to varying degrees by scholarly authors.

In this note, I show that even if one's goal is purely to make predictive inferences in the population from which one's training data was sampled, making use of causal inference techniques may be fundamental to produce principled predictions.
